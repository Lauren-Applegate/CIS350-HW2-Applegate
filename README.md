# Lauren Applegate
* In my free time I like to drink coffee, go for runs, and read
* I started coding during my sophmore year of high school
* In the future I want to design and code websites

## Technical Background
* I started coding in Java in high school and did well on my AP test and recieved college credit. Since GV starts in python I decided to retake 162 to learn that language and set me up better for 163. I am now currently a sophmore learning how to use linux and git.
